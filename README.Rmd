Helps access various Fantasy Football APIs (i.e. MFL, Sleeper, Fleaflicker, ESPN, Yahoo, potentially other platforms) by handling authentication and rate-limiting, forming appropriate calls, and returning tidy dataframes which can be easily connected to other data sources.

### Installation
Install from GitHub with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") OR install.packages("remotes")
## remotes is a subpackage of devtools
remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffscrapr")
```

### Usage

All `ffscrapr` functions start with a connection object created by ff_connect, which stores connection, authentication, and other user-defined parameters. This object is used by all other functions to help return the correct data.

```{r}
library(ffscrapr)
ssb <- ff_connect(platform = "mfl", league_id = "54040", season = 2020)

# Get a summary of league settings
ff_league(ssb) %>% str()

# Get rosters
ff_rosters(ssb)

# Get transactions
ff_transactions(ssb)

```

For a more detailed usage example, including a template dynasty league analysis script, please check out the reference articles and/or vignettes!
