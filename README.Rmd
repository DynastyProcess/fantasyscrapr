Helps access various Fantasy Football APIs (currently MFL, Sleeper, Fleaflicker, and eventually ESPN, Yahoo, potentially others) by handling authentication/rate-limiting/caching, forming appropriate calls, and returning tidy dataframes which can be easily connected to other data sources.

### Installation

Version 1.2.1 is now on CRAN ðŸŽ‰ and can be installed with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ffscrapr")
# or from GitHub release with the remotes package # install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffscrapr",ref = "v1.2.1")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffscrapr")
```

The dev version has a [separate documentation site here](https://ffscrapr.dynastyprocess.com/dev/).

### Usage

All `ffscrapr` functions start with a connection object created by `ff_connect()`, which stores connection, authentication, and other user-defined parameters. This object is used by all other functions to help return the correct data.

```{r}
library(ffscrapr)
ssb <- ff_connect(platform = "mfl", league_id = "54040", season = 2020)

# Get a summary of league settings
ff_league(ssb) %>% str()

# Get rosters
ff_rosters(ssb)

# Get transactions
ff_transactions(ssb)

```

For a more detailed usage example, including a template dynasty league analysis script, please check out the reference articles and/or vignettes!
