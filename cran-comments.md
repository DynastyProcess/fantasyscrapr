## RESUBMISSION OF RESUBMISSION
This is a followup resubmission - I apologize for not understanding the mechanics of the title field on previous submissions. Have removed the "ffscrapr:" chunk from the title as suggested - and thank you for your patience!

## RESUBMISSION

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have: 
* Converted broken/missing file URIs to fully specified URLs
* Adjusted the title to title case ("ffscrapr: API Client for Fantasy Football Platforms")
* Added the API URL to the URL section

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.3
* Mac OSX - on github actions, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on github actions), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* Some examples may take slightly longer than 5 seconds to run - this is partially due to built-in API ratelimiting.

## Downstream dependencies
This is a new package that has no downstream dependencies.
